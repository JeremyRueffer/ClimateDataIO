The purpose of ClimateDataIO is not purely to load individual files but to do other basic tasks involving the data. A LOAD function will work on multiple files and can load files based on a time span. In all cases the timestamps are also generated (SLT files only) or parsed. A few functions exist to correct problems in the data (SLTTRIM, SLTTIMESHIFT, SLTWRITE, LICOR_SPLIT).

This is a work in progress. The functions are fully functional but their names will probably changed as things are standardized. Once that is complete this package will then be registered so it can be imported with `Pkg.add("ClimateDataIO")`. After it has been registered, basic reading components will be added to [FileIO](https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl) whenever reasonably possible.

## Aerodyne

Both STR and STC files are simple column-separated ASCII text files. STC files have two header lines whereas the STR have only one.

### STR Header
```
12/10/2016 00:00:00 0.004 3564172800.000 23:00:00 SPEC:NH3
```

### STC Header
```
12/10/2016 00:00:00 0.004 3564172800.000 23:00:00 SPEC:NH3
time, Range_F 1_L 1, Zero_F 1, Range_F 2_L 1, Zero_F 2, Praw, Traw, AD2, Tref, AD6, AD7, StatusW, ValveW, VICI_W, USBByte, NI6024Byte, SPEFile, T Laser 1, V Laser 1, LW Laser 1,  dT1,  X1,  pos1,  ConvergenceWord,  ChillerT,  CV1_Volts
```

The timestamps are seconds from January 1, 1904.


```julia
epoch = DateTime(1904)
Traw = 3564187199.917300
T = epoch + Dates.Second(floor(Traw)) + Dates.Millisecond(floor(1000(Traw - floor(Traw))))
```

## Campbell Scientific

DAT files are simple comma-separated ASCII text files with four header lines.

### TOA5 Header
```
"TOA5","CR1000 - IP","CR1000","E2948","CR1000.Std.22","CPU:LoggerCode.CR1","35271","Rotronics_HC2S3"
"TIMESTAMP","RECORD","AirTemp_HC2S3_S01","RelHum_HC2S3_S01","AirTemp_HC2S3_S02","RelHum_HC2S3_S02","AirTemp_HC2S3_S03","RelHum_HC2S3_S03","AirTemp_HC2S3_S04","RelHum_HC2S3_S04"
"TS","RN","Deg C","%","Deg C","%","Deg C","%","Deg C","%"
"","","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp"
```
The first line contains format (TOA5), logger, and logger code information. The remaining three lines relate to each column. The second line is the list of column names followed by the column units, and finally how they were collected. "Smp" means sample and "Avg" means average.

Timestamps are full text dates and times.

```julia
Traw = "2016-12-01 00:00:00"
T = DateTime(Traw,"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS")
```

## EddyMeas

SLT files are binary but all other related files are ASCII text. All other files contain metadata and processed data from the SLT files. For more information see page 15 of the [EddySoft](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/Freiland/index.php/Sofware/Software) manual.

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| SLT | Data |
| CFG | Instrument settings |
| LOG | Log information |
| FLX | ? |
| CSU | ? |
| CSR | ? |
| CSV | ? |

## Los Gatos Research

The TXT files generated by the LGR instruments are simple fixed-width comma-separated ASCII text files with two header lines.

### Header
```
VC:904M BD:May 23 2013 SN:LGR-13-0171
                     Time,      [CH4]_ppm,   [CH4]_ppm_sd,      [H2O]_ppm,   [H2O]_ppm_sd,      [CO2]_ppm,   [CO2]_ppm_sd,     [CH4]d_ppm,  [CH4]d_ppm_sd,     [CO2]d_ppm,  [CO2]d_ppm_sd,      GasP_torr,   GasP_torr_sd,         GasT_C,      GasT_C_sd,         AmbT_C,      AmbT_C_sd,         RD0_us,      RD0_us_sd,         RD1_us,      RD1_us_sd,       Fit_Flag,            MIU
```

Timestamps are full text dates and times.

```julia
Traw = "30/01/2015 15:13:47.994"
T = DateTime(Traw,"dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM:SS.sss")
```
